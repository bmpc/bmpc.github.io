Hello and welcome to my blog! 

My name is Bruno Conde. I'm a Software Engineer, co-founder and manager at [Atlera](https://www.atlera.io/) and Product Manager of [Xray](https://www.getxray.app/), a Test Management tool for Jira. I was also the Xray lead developer for many years.

Before that, I worked at [Morphis Tech](https://morphis-tech.com/) creating language parsers, static analysers, migraton tools and IDEs.

A long, long time ago, I participated in the [Imagine Cup](https://imaginecup.microsoft.com/) world-wide finals with a project called XSMobile to summarize web pages for hand-held devices such as PDAs.

I created this blog to share some projects and war stories, hoping these might help someone.

The name for this blog was inspired in my favorite quote:

*I do not know what I may appear to the world, but to myself I seem to have been only like a boy playing on the seashore, and diverting myself in now and then finding a smoother pebble or a prettier shell than ordinary, whilst the great ocean of truth lay all undiscovered before me.* - Sir Isaac Newton
